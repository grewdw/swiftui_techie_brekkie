## Declarative UI Framework

- Everything element is built from a basic View Struct
- Out of the box Views for things like lists, buttons, images text fields etc.
- As these are declarative they will automatically stay in line with the current styling of apple platforms

## Cross Platform

- The same code will run on all of Apple's platforms, iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS
- It will adjust for the idioms of the platform
- However, can't assume that what looks right on one platform will look right on another
